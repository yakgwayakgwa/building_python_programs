Q1.1.1. Why do computers use binary numbers?
A1.1.1. Computers use binary numbers because this system offers a more efficient way for electronic devices to distinguish 
between their on (1) and off (0) states.

Q1.1.3. Convert each of the following decimal numbers into its equivalent binary number:
     Q1.1.2.a. 100
     Q1.1.2.b. 1011
     Q1.1.2.c. 101010
     Q1.1.2.d. 1001110   
A1.1.3.a. 100 --> 4
       1 | 2^2 | 4
       0 | 2^1 | 0
       0 | 2^0 | 0
       4 + 0 + 0 = 4
A1.1.3.b. 1011 --> 11
       1 | 2^3 | 8
       0 | 2^2 | 0
       1 | 2^1 | 2
       1 | 2^0 | 1
       8 + 2 + 1 = 11
A1.1.3.c. 101010 --> 42
       1 | 2^5 | 32

       0 | 2^2 | 0
       1 | 2^1 | 2
       0 | 2^0 | 0
       32 + 8 + 2 = 42
A1.1.3.d. 1001110 --> 78
       1 | 2^6 | 64
       0 | 2^5 | 0
       0 | 2^4 | 0
       1 | 2^3 | 8

       64 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 78

Q1.1.4. In your own words, describe an algorithm for baking cookies. Assume that you have a 
large number of hungry friends, so youâ€™ll want to produce several batches of cookies!
A1.1.4. The objective here is to understand that an algorithm is comprised of a series of 
well-defined, independent, repeatable steps that generate a predictable outcome.
